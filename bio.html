        <h3>A little about me....</h3>
    <br>
        <p>Hi, I’m Jay Little! I’m a Seattle native and have lived in the PNW for over 25 years. At the moment, I’m a student at the UW Coding Bootcamp where I’m learning to be a Web Developer. Some of the skills I’m picking up are: javascript, HTML and CSS. In my former life and career, I worked in HR at Amazon and Microsoft for over 15 years.</p>

        <p>I’ve a lot of hobbies besides building webpages. I’m a former college athlete in Swimming and Water Polo and I remain active in my spare time. I run often and snowboard in the winters. I also try to keep up with my lively Golden Retriever named Rainier! I do a lot of travel around the PNW and I love getting outdoors. I camp and hike in the summers. I like to ride my bicycle. Best of all, I got married in Oct 2019 to my beautiful wife, Meg!</p>
